### Username and Password Registration and Login with Two Factor Authentication

### Purpose

This test code is meant to provide two functions:

1. register a username and password within a certain criteria 
    - the criteria is meant to prevent the following attacks[^1]
        - cross-site scripting
        - SQL injection
        - cross-site relay
        - man-in-the-middle

    - username criteria:
        - length between 5 and 16 characters
        - no spaces between characters
        - no special symbols

    - password criteria:
        - length between 8 and 16 characters
        - at least one uppercase character included
        - at least one digit included
        - no spaces between characters
        - at least one of the following special symbols included: ! @ # $ % &
        - produce a salted hash of the accepted password

2. provide a secure user login
    - the username must match with a case-specific cross-check
    - the password must match the salted hash archived
    - user must provide an OTP through Two Factor Authorization

### Installation

To install the test code, the code repository must be downloaded to a main repository on an OS. For example:

[Picture of main repo for code repo]

Because the test code does not have a GUI, it should be executed in a terminal, and can be done with the following steps:
1. Open the terminal program linked to the OS
2. Navigate to the code repository wherein the 'main.py' file is located
3. In the terminal, type the following:
    **Linux**
    '''python3 main.py'''
    **Powershell**
    '''
    python3
    >>> main.py
    '''
    **MacOS**
    '''python3 main.py'''
4. Press the 'enter' key

### Code Construction

#### Object Oriented Programming

The code has been written with an object-oriented approach, as this approach "is defined by describing a collection of interacting objects via their data and behavior (Phillips , 2018: 7) and thus allows for the easy manipulation of objects through functions.

The following classes are used to create a username and password:

    '''
    CreateUsername
    CreatePassword
    EncryptPass
    '''

These classes and functions can be viewed indepth in create_user_classes.py

The login program uses two separate classes:

    '''
    VerifyUser
    VerifyPass
    '''

These classes and functions can be viewed indepth in login_classes.py

#### Main Program File

The main.py program file has the following important characteristics:

- Imported classes along with '''install pyotp''' to implement Two Factor Authorization.

 - An empty dictionary '''user_1 = {}''' which stores the user profile input and provides cross-check information for the subsequent login program.

- while loops for username creation, password creation, username login, and password login

- A value of 1 assigned to successful input

- An empty list '''success = []''' which adds  positive integer increment to the variable '''success_count'''

- A counter '''success_count = 0''', which accepts or rejects input based on the the input value

- A print mechanism for hashed input

Information stored in the user dictionary is used to cross-check the username and password upon user login. A successful entry of the password is required to engage Two Factor Authorization.

### Execution

Execution of the program results in the following:

The program also provides instructions for input that does not meet the username or password criteria for registration and/or login:

### Testcode Data

Testcode performed for the various functions and the main program can be found in the repository '''coding_project/testcode'''.
